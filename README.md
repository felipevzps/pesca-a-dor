# pesca-a-dor

This document describes the operation and use of [pesca-a-dor](https://github.com/felipevzps/pesca-a-dor), developed to automate the fishing process in the [PxG](https://www.pokexgames.com/). This bot has been developed to `fish`, `cast spells on shiny Pokémon`, `capture shiny Pokémon`, `collect loot`, and `solve the periodic fishing challenge` that appears on the screen every 5 minutes, allowing uninterrupted fishing.

## Requirements

```bash
pip install pyautogui
pip install keyboard
pip install Pillow
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage

Before proceeding, reduce your monitor resolution to `1024x768`. This step is essential for accurately obtaining screen coordinates for specific variables within the software. These variables include:

```python
FISHING_POSITIONS = (280, 382)    # The location where the bait will be cast
IMG_BUBBLE_SIZE = (25, 28)        # The size of the bubble image
POKEBALL_POSITION = (838, 237)    # The position of the Pokémon's Pokéball
POKE_POSITION = (410, 242)        # The position where the Pokémon will remain stationary
```

Please note the following:

To acquire the coordinates for each of these positions, you must execute [locateOnScreen.py](https://github.com/felipevzps/pesca-a-dor/blob/main/locateOnScreen.py) within vscode and hover your mouse over the desired locations while the script is running. For instance, to obtain the coordinates for `POKEBALL_POSITION`, position your mouse cursor over the Pokémon pokéball and retrieve the coordinates from the first print statement generated by the script (e.g., `print(pyautogui.position())`).

Ensuring that your mouse is positioned accurately during this process is crucial for obtaining precise left and top coordinates for your defined screen positions.
